## Module 2 -- Elements of genetic association Classes from 9:30am to 17:30pm

The purpose of this module is to get into the basic considerations of the genetic association studies. At end of the module, you will be able to conduct the relevant analyses.

### Lecture 2

Chromosomes, DNA, QC, alleles, genotypes, HWE, mode of inheritance, haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium, GxG and GxE interactions

Phenotype: QC, transformation

Study designs: case-control, case-cohort, family

Association models: linear, logistic, Cox regression models; R^2, AUC, Cstat

Meta-analysis: fixed and random effects models

Missing data models

Population stratification and genomic controls

### Lab 2

#### Linux

HaploView

Gene annotation using UCSC: genes, strand, builds and liftover, regions

#### R packages

Modern data manipulation with dplyr, tidyr, tidyverse

Grammar of graphics with ggplot2

glm

metafor
