## Module II. Elements of genetic association

9:30am -- 17:30pm

The purpose of this module is to get into the basic considerations of the genetic association studies. At end of the module, you will be able to conduct the relevant analyses.

### Lecture

9:30am -- 12:30pm

Chromosomes, DNA, QC, alleles, genotypes, HWE, mode of inheritance, haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium, GxG and GxE interactions

Phenotype: QC, transformation

Study designs: case-control, case-cohort, family

Association models: linear, logistic, Cox regression models; R^2, AUC, Cstat

Meta-analysis: fixed and random effects models

Missing data models

Population stratification and genomic controls

### Computer session
