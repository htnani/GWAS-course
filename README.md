# This seeds a collection of utilities for GWAS

As a first instance, here are some scripts using HESS (https://github.com/huwenboshi/hess) for heritability estimation of QUS data. My working directory is /genetics/bin/hess and my output directory is tests.

NOTE HESS describes what should have been a .bim file as a .bed file, yet the latter is generic, as with UCSC 
(https://genome.ucsc.edu/).
