### Monday 23rd -- Classes from 9:30am to 17:30pm

## Module 1 -- Overview

The purpose of this module is provide a grand view of genetic dissection of complex traits as well as the technological development which lead to GWAS. It will also set stage for later parts of the workshop.

### Lecture 1

* Introduction

   Self-introduction

   Workshop outlines

   The roadmap to GWAS -- Background, study designs, implementations

* Linux

   A rich variety of open-source software is available for system administration, database management, Internet facility and development environment including system-level commands and utilities to enable powerful high-level programming languages such as C/C++/Fortran/Python are readily available. R is built on these.

* R for reproducible research

   A combination of data management, statistical analysis, graphics, programming in a unified environment, it enjoys ever-growing user-base and facilities.
