## Module 1 -- Overview

9:30am -- 17:30pm

The purpose of this module is provide a grand view of genetic dissection of complex traits as well as the technological development which lead to GWAS. It will also set stage for later parts of the workshop.

### Lecture 1

9:30am -- 12:30pm

#### Introduction - background, purpose

#### The roadmap to GWAS

Background, study designs, implementations

Workshop outlines

#### Linux

A rich variety of open-source software is available for system administration, database management, Internet facility and development environment including system-level commands and utilities to enable powerful high-level programming languages such as C/C++/Fortran/Python are readily available. R is built on these.

##### R for reproducible research

A combination of data management, statistical analysis, graphics, programming in a unified environment, it enjoys ever-growing user-base and facilities.
