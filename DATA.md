## Summary statistics

[NHGRI-EBI list of studies with summary statistics](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary-statistics).

## Individual level data

[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). `The database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) was developed to archive and distribute the data and results from studies that have investigated the interaction of genotype and phenotype in Humans.`

[EGA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home). `The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) allows you to explore datasets from genomic studies, provided by a range of data providers. Access to datasets must be approved by the specified Data Access Committee (DAC).`

[GAW](https://www.gaworkshop.org/). `The Genetic Analysis Workshops (GAWs) are a collaborative effort among genetic epidemiologists to evaluate and compare statistical genetic methods. For each GAW, topics are chosen that are relevant to current analytical problems in genetic epidemiology, and sets of real or computer-simulated data are distributed to investigators worldwide.  Results of analyses are discussed and compared at meetings held in even-numbered years.`

[1000 Genomes project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/) contains information on available data, software and publications.

[The Haplotype Reference Consortium](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) creats a large reference panel of human haplotypes by combining together sequencing data from multiple cohorts.

## Integration of expression and methylation data

[ROADMAP and ENDCODE epigenomics data](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/) has information for a total of 127 consolidated epigenomes.
