# Code used in the SpiroMeta contribution

A SpiroMeta call for HRC imputation data contribution requires [imputation checker](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/tools/Post-Imputation.html), which in turn requires GD::Graph module from `Perl`.

`st.sh` shows how to install GD::Graph module.

Note that `impute.list` and `impute.id` as in `bolt.sh` contain list of chromosome-specific imputed genotypes and list of individuals, respectively.
