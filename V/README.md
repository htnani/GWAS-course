## Module V. Additional topics

### Consortium collaborations

For instance,

[CHARGE consortium](http://www.chargeconsortium.com/). `The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium was formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication opportunities among multiple large and well-phenotyped longitudinal cohort studies.`

[GIANT consortium](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium). `The Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium is an international collaboration that seeks to identify genetic loci that modulate human body size and shape, including height and measures of obesity. The GIANT consortium is a collaboration between investigators from many different groups, institutions, countries, and studies, and the results represent their combined efforts. The primary approach has been meta-analysis of genome-wide association data and other large-scale genetic data sets. Anthropometric traits that have been studied by GIANT include body mass index (BMI), height, and traits related to waist circumference (such as waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, or WHRadjBMI). Thus far, the GIANT consortium has identified common genetic variants at hundreds of loci that are associated with anthropometric traits.`

[SSGAC](https://www.thessgac.org/). `The SSGAC is a cooperative enterprise among medical researchers and social scientists that coordinates genetic association studies for social science outcomes and provides a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-fertilization of ideas. The SSGAC also tries to promote the collection of harmonized and well-measured phenotypes.`.

### Individual level data

[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). `The database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) was developed to archive and distribute the data and results from studies that have investigated the interaction of genotype and phenotype in Humans.`

[EGA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home). `The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) allows you to explore datasets from genomic studies, provided by a range of data providers. Access to datasets must be approved by the specified Data Access Committee (DAC).`

[GAW](https://www.gaworkshop.org/). `The Genetic Analysis Workshops (GAWs) are a collaborative effort among genetic epidemiologists to evaluate and compare statistical genetic methods. For each GAW, topics are chosen that are relevant to current analytical problems in genetic epidemiology, and sets of real or computer-simulated data are distributed to investigators worldwide.  Results of analyses are discussed and compared at meetings held in even-numbered years.`

[1000 Genomes project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/) contains information on available data, software and publications.

### Summary statistics

Conditional/joint analysis

Microarray, methylation, TWAS, summary statistics

Mendelian randomization

[R2BGLiMS](https://github.com/pjnewcombe/R2BGLiMS), R wrapper for a Java Bayesian GLM variable selection package including `JAM`.

#### Integration of expression and methylation data

[ROADMAP and ENDCODE epigenomics data](http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/) has information for a total of 127 consolidated epigenomes.

[GTEx portal](https://gtexportal.org/home/).

[FUSION](https://github.com/gusevlab/fusion_twas). `methods for functional summary-based imputation.`

[frea-pipeline](https://github.com/aksarkar/frea-pipeline). `Functional Region Enrichment Analysis.`

[GenoSkyline-Plus](http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoSkyline). `GenoSkyline is a principled framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions through integrating high-throughput epigenomic annotations. Integrative analysis of GenoSkyline annotations with GWAS summary statistics could systematically identify biologically relevant tissue types and provide novel insights into the genetic basis of human complex traits.`

[UES](https://github.com/JamesHayes/uesEnrichment) `Uncovering Enrichment through Simulation) Algorithm Developmenty`.

#### Generic software systems

[JAGS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/). `JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for the statistical analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models by Markov Chain Monte Carlo.`

[SAS](http://www.sas.com). `SAS (pronounced "sass") once stood for "statistical analysis system." It began at North Carolina State University as a project to analyze agricultural research. Demand for such software capabilities began to grow, and SAS was founded in 1976 to help customers in all sorts of industries – from pharmaceutical companies and banks to academic and governmental entities. SAS – both the software and the company – thrived throughout the next few decades. Development of the software attained new heights in the industry because it could run across all platforms, using the multivendor architecture for which it is known today. While the scope of the company has spread across the globe, the encouraging and innovative corporate culture has remained the same.`

[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/). `Thousands of users rely on Stan for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction in the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and business.`

[Stata](http://www.stata.com). `Stata is a complete, integrated statistical software package that provides everything you need for data analysis, data management, and graphics.`
