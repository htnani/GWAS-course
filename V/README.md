### Friday 27th -- Classes from 9:30am to 17:30pm

## Module 5 -- Additional topics

The module will look further into several other areas of research in GWAS, to be followed by some case studies.

### Lecture 5

Consortium collaboration: Gene-Lifestyle Interactions (CHARGE), Educational Attainment Analysis (SSGAC), Global Lipids Genetics/GIANT Consortium HRC and 1KG phase3

1. Conditional/joint analysis

2. Mendelian randomization

3. Microarray, methylation, TWAS

[CHARGE consortium](http://www.chargeconsortium.com/). `The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium was formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication opportunities among multiple large and well-phenotyped longitudinal cohort studies.`

[GIANT consortium](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium). `The Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium is an international collaboration that seeks to identify genetic loci that modulate human body size and shape, including height and measures of obesity. The GIANT consortium is a collaboration between investigators from many different groups, institutions, countries, and studies, and the results represent their combined efforts. The primary approach has been meta-analysis of genome-wide association data and other large-scale genetic data sets. Anthropometric traits that have been studied by GIANT include body mass index (BMI), height, and traits related to waist circumference (such as waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, or WHRadjBMI). Thus far, the GIANT consortium has identified common genetic variants at hundreds of loci that are associated with anthropometric traits.`

[SSGAC](https://www.thessgac.org/). `The SSGAC is a cooperative enterprise among medical researchers and social scientists that coordinates genetic association studies for social science outcomes and provides a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-fertilization of ideas. The SSGAC also tries to promote the collection of harmonized and well-measured phenotypes.`.

**Case studies**

A SpiroMeta call for HRC imputation data contribution is shown in [SpiroMeta](../SpiroMeta) directory.

An example for rare variant analysis are available from the [GLGC-GIANT](../GLGC-GIANT) directory.
